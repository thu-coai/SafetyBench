SafetyBench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the safety of LLMs, which comprises 11,435 diverse multiple choice questions spanning across 7 distinct categories of safety concerns. SafetyBench also incorporates both Chinese and English data, facilitating the evaluation in both languages. Please visit our [website](https://llmbench.ai/safety) or check our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07045) for more details.

## News
**🎉 `2025/07/28`:** As LLM safety has significantly improved in recent years, we’ve decided to fully open-source our test answers under `opensource_data`! Please refer to `eva.py` for example usage.

**🎉 `2024/06/24`:** SafetyBench has been accepted by the ACL 2024 Main Conference. See our camera-ready version of the paper at [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07045). SafetyBench is also integrated into [SuperBench](https://fm.ai.tsinghua.edu.cn/superbench/#/).

## Leaderboard
The up-to-date leaderboards are on our [website](https://llmbench.ai/safety). We have three leaderboards for Chinese, English and Chinese subset respectively. We remove questions with highly sensitive keywords and downsample 300 questions for each category to construct the Chinese subset. Summarized evaluation results of some representative LLMs are shown below:

## Data
### Download
We put our data on the [Hugging Face website](https://huggingface.co/datasets/thu-coai/SafetyBench).

You can download the test questions and few-shot examples through `wget` directly. Just run the script [`download_data.sh`](./code/download_data.sh)

Alternatively, you can download the test questions and few-shot examples through the `datasets` library. Just run the code [`download_data.py`](./code/download_data.py)

### Description
`test_zh`, `test_en` and `test_zh_subset` contain test questions for Chinese, English and Chinese subset respectively. `dev_zh` and `dev_en` contain 5 examples for each safety category, which can be used as few-shot demonstrations. 

Note that the `options` field in the data includes at most four items, corresponding to the options A, B, C, D in order. For the `answer` field in the dev data, the mapping rule is: 0->A, 1->B, 2->C, 3->D.

## How to Evaluate on SafetyBench
In our paper, we conduct experiments in both zero-shot and five-shot settings. And we extract the predicted answers from models' responses. An example of evaluation code could be found at [code](./code/evaluate_baichuan.py). We don’t include CoT-based evaluation because SafetyBench is less reasoning-intensive than benchmarks testing the model’s
general capabilities such as MMLU. But feel free to submit your results based on CoT. The default prompt for zero-shot and five-shot evaluation is shown below:
![figure](./figs/eva_prompts.png)

To enable more accurate extraction of the predicted answers, we made minor changes to the prompts for some models, which is shown below:

## How to Submit
You need to first prepare a UTF-8 encoded JSON file with the following format, please refer to [submission_example.json](./submission_example.json) for details.

```
## key is the "id" field of the test questions
## value is the predicted answer: 0->A, 1->B, 2->C, 3->D
{
    "0": 0,
    "1": 1,
    "2": 3,
    "3": 2 
}
```

Then you can submit the JSON file to our [website](https://llmbench.ai/safety).
